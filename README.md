#  DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF ABNORMAL STUDENT BEHAVIORS IN ONLINE EXAMS USING DEEP LEARNING


This project is focused on the development of an intelligent, deep learning-driven system for
real-time detection and classification of abnormal student behaviors observed during online
examinations. With the increasing reliance on digital learning platforms and the associated risks
of academic dishonesty, there is a pressing need for automated monitoring tools that can
augment or replace traditional proctoring methods. The system will leverage a convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically ResNet18, to process and analyze image data
extracted from online exam scenarios. The training and evaluation process will be conducted
using the "Students' Abnormal Behavior in Online Exam Dataset," which comprises annotated
images representing five behavior categories: use of mobile devices, hand movements, eye
movements, mouth opening, and students looking away from the screen. This dataset is
structured in the YOLO DarkNet53 COCO format, facilitating seamless integration into object
detection pipelines. The entire implementation will be carried out using the PyTorch deep
learning framework on Google Colab, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility. Upon
completion, the system aims to provide a highly accurate, real-time behavior classification tool
that can assist educators in identifying potential instances of cheating or inattentiveness,
thereby reinforcing the integrity and fairness of online examinations.
